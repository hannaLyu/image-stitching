2. the principles of feature detection & matching, tracking.
3. learn robust estimation like RANSAC.
4. camera model calibration.
5. learn two view geometry: fundamental, essential, homography matrices.
6. know how to use direct linear method for homography & fundamental matrices estimation.
7. know how to decompose homography matrix.
8. the principle of Inertial Measurement Unit.
9. Sensor fusion for attitude estimation: Kalman filter.
10. Image stiching.

### Content:
